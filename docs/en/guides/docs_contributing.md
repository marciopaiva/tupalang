# Documentation Contribution Guide

## Purpose

This document standardizes documentation changes to keep quality and consistency.

## Scope

English is the canonical language in `docs/`. Translations live under `docs/pt-br` and `docs/es` when available. Keep translations aligned with the English version and note when a page is pending.

## Single Source

The canonical content lives in `docs/`. The wiki is updated automatically via CI.

## Writing Standards

- Avoid jargon without an explanation.
- Use objective, predictable headings.
