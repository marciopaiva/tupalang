- Effect System: IO/Random/Time tracked at compile time
- Hybrid backend: LLVM for APIs + JSON for pipelines

3/ 🛡️ Who is it for?
- ML engineers with production audit needs
- Fintech/healthtech developers with strict compliance
- Anyone who wants governance without sacrificing performance

4/ 🚀 Get started
```
tupa new my-audit-pipeline
cd my-audit-pipeline
tupa run --pipeline=FraudDetection --input=tx.json
```

5/ 📚 Docs
- PIPELINE_GUIDE.md
- EXECUTION_PLAN_SCHEMA.md
